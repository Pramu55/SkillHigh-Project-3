# Face Mask Detection 🏷️😷

**Final Year Project** | **Computer Vision** | **Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras**

---

## Overview

This project detects whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in real-time images or video streams. Using deep learning and computer vision techniques, the system classifies faces into “Mask” or “No Mask” categories to help promote safety compliance, especially relevant in public health scenarios.

---

## Features

- **Face Detection:** Uses OpenCV's pre-trained Haar cascades or SSD models to detect faces in images/video.
- **Mask Classification:** CNN-based model to classify detected faces as wearing a mask or not.
- **Real-Time Detection:** Processes webcam feed or video files for live mask detection.
- **Alerts:** Optional visual indicators or alerts for “No Mask” detection.
- **Dataset:** Trained on publicly available face mask datasets.

## Setup and Usage

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd face_mask_detection_project
````

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Train the model** (optional, pre-trained model included)

```bash
python src/train.py
```

5. **Run real-time detection**

```bash
python src/detect_mask.py
```

This will open your webcam and detect faces with/without masks in real-time.

## Dataset

The project uses publicly available datasets such as:

* [Face Mask Dataset](https://github.com/X-zhangyang/Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset)
* [Masked Face Recognition Dataset and Application (MFR2)](https://github.com/cabani/MaskedFace-Net)

---

## Model Details

* **Architecture:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
* **Preprocessing:** Face detection + image resizing and normalization
* **Output:** Binary classification (Mask vs No Mask)

---

## Results

* Achieves high accuracy and fast inference on live video streams.
* Provides bounding boxes with labels around detected faces.
* Can be extended to trigger alerts or log compliance data.

---

## Future Improvements

* Integrate with mobile or embedded devices for edge detection.
* Improve accuracy with more diverse datasets.
* Add multi-class classification (e.g., improper mask usage).
* Deploy as a web or mobile app with cloud backend.
